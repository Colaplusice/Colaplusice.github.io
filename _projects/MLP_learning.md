title: Learning-based task of manipulator to execute throwing task
description:
---
 We use the MLP to construct a learning neural network to execute a throwing task. The input of the neural network is a 13 dimension vector (4 for posture (quaternion) and 3 for position of the hand, and 6 for twist velocity of the throw action), and the outout is a 7 dimension vector. (landing position and posture).
 
 The whole throwing process is available here.
