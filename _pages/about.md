I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineer from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), Jinan, China, in 2019. I am currently pursuing the M.E. degree in Computer Technology with the School of Information Science and Engineering, [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), Lanzhou, China. My main research interests include robotics, neural networks, intelligent information processing, artificial intelligence and optimization theory.
