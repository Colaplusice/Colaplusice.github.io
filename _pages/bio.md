* 2015-2019                                [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/),    (Bachelor of Engineering, Software Engineering)

### Research/Project Experience
#### Research on control of  Redundant Manipulators  (Lanzhou University)

- Developing a control strategy based on the quadratic programming (QP) problem for dual-arm robots
- Proposing a motion-force control scheme based on kinematics for redundant manipulators with unknown structural information 
- Proposing a control scheme for redundant manipulators with unknown structural information by applying joint constraints of the acceleration level to control the manipulator at the joint velocity level
- Doing ongoing research to extend the application of the Jacobian matrix learning scheme and motion-force control scheme to mobile robots with the effectiveness of the proposed scheme having been proved through theoretical analyses, simulations and physical experiments
