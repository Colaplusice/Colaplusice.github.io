abstract={We present the design and implementation of a taskable reactive mobile manipulation system. In contrary to related work, we treat the arm and base degrees of freedom as a holistic structure which greatly improves the speed and fluidity of the resulting motion. At the core of this approach is a robust and reactive motion controller which can achieve a desired end-effector pose, while avoiding joint position and velocity limits, and ensuring the mobile manipulator is manoeuvrable throughout the trajectory. This can support sensor-based behaviours such as closed-loop visual grasping. As no planning is involved in our approach, the robot is never stationary thinking about what to do next. We show the versatility of our holistic motion controller by implementing a pick and place system using behaviour trees and demonstrate this task on a 9-degree-of-freedom mobile manipulator.},

 title={A Simultaneous Learning and Control Scheme for Redundant Manipulators With Physical Constraints on Decision Variable and Its Derivative},
 year={2022},
 publisher={IEEE},
 abstract={In this article, a simultaneous learning and control scheme built on the joint velocity level with physical constraints on the decision variable and its derivative, i.e., joint angle, joint velocity, and joint acceleration constraints, is proposed for the redundant manipulator control. The scheme works when the structure parameters involved in the forward kinematics are unknown or implicit. The learning and control parts are incorporated simultaneously in the scheme, which is finally formulated as a quadratic programming problem solved by a devised recurrent neural network (RNN). The convergences of learning and control abilities of the RNN are proved theoretically. Simulations and physical experiments on a 7-degrees of freedom (DOFs) redundant manipulator show that, aided with the proposed scheme and the related RNN solver, a redundant manipulator with unknown structure parameters can perform a given inverse kinematics task with high accuracy while satisfying physical constraints on the decision variable and its derivative.},

  abstract={Currently, the Newton–Raphson iterative algorithm has been extensively employed in the fields of basic research and engineering. However, when noise components exist in a system, its performance is largely affected. To remedy shortcomings that the conventional computing methods have encountered in a noisy workspace, a novel modified Newton integration (MNI) algorithm is proposed in this article. In addition, the steady-state error of the proposed MNI algorithm is smaller than that of the Newton–Raphson algorithm under a noise-free or noisy workspace. To lay the foundations for the corresponding theoretical analyses, the proposed MNI algorithm is first converted into a homogeneous linear equation with a residual term. Then, the related theoretical analyses are carried out, which indicate that the MNI algorithm possesses noise-tolerance ability under various noisy environments. Finally, multiple computer simulations and physical experiments on robot control applications are performed to verify the feasibility and advantage of the proposed MNI algorithm.},
