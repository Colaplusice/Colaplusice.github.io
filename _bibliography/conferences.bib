abstract={Existing open set classifiers distinguish between known and unknown inputs by measuring distance in a network's logit space, assuming that known inputs cluster closer to the training data than unknown inputs. However, this approach is typically applied post-hoc to networks trained with cross-entropy loss, which neither guarantees nor encourages the hoped-for clustering behaviour. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Class Anchor Clustering (CAC) loss. CAC is an entirely distance-based loss that explicitly encourages training data to form tight clusters techniques on the challenging TinyImageNet dataset, achieving a 2.4% performance increase in AUROC. },

abstract={Dual-arm robotic systems have great advantages over the single-arm robotic system, for the arms can either run independently or cooperate to finish the task. In this paper, minimum kinetic energy (MKE) is concerned as a performance index for the planning and control of a dual-arm robotic system. First, two sub schemes are formulated on the left arm and right arm of the robot, which are constructed on velocity level with consideration of manipulatorsâ€™ physical constraints. Then, the two sub schemes are unified into one scheme, which is finally transformed into a quadratic program (QP) problem. For solving the formulated QP problem, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is devised based on the Lagrange multiplier method. At last, the simulations and simulative experiments on a dual-arm redundant robotic system named Baxter are carried out. The simulation results reveal that the devised RNN model has a good performance for solving the presented MKE scheme applying to the dual-arm robotic system.},
